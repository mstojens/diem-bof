# Name: Digital Emblems v2
## Description 

International law defines a number of emblems, such as the blue
helmets of United Nations peacekeeping forces, as indicative of special protections.
Similar protections are associated with journalists who wear
"Press" protective emblems on the battlefield, under Article 79 of
Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions and Resolution 2222 of the
United Nations Security Council. The emblems of national governments
and inter-governmental organizations protect diplomatic pouches,
couriers, and envoys under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations. Other marks enjoy protections against mis-use under the
Paris Convention, the Madrid Protocol, and the Trade-Related Aspects
of Intellectual Property Rights.

For some uses cases, emblems are needed for digital assets without an 
obvious physical form, as physical emblems do not translate to the digital realm. 
For example, there is no current capability that allows an organization
to indicate that its digital infrastructure should be afforded
protections under an international law due to its use in a physical mission.

For other use cases, physical emblems may also suffer from a number of weaknesses
in their current usage, such as having hard-to-update metadata or a need to be
updated with an access log. These require a digital counterpart to the physical
emblem where both are attached to a physical object.

The Digital Emblem BoF at IETF 120 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/diem/about/)
explored the problem space, discussed technical requirements from various
stakeholders, and helped frame the problem in terms of potential efforts within the
IETF. A wide variety of use cases, some of which have conflicting requirements,
led to a lack of consensus on IETF-adoptable scope but consensus that something
in the space should be worked on (by a show of hands in Meetecho). The end of the
BoF discussion indicated multiple scopes of work with some common overlap may need
to be defined.

This BoF is a venue for discussing the chartering of perspective work on the topic
of digital emblems and what useful scopes can be taken on by existing WGs or will
require a new WG.
