# Name: Digital Emblems v2
## Description 

International law defines a number of emblems, such as the blue
helmets of United Nations peacekeeping forces, as indicative of special protections.
Similar protections are associated with journalists who wear
"Press" protective emblems on the battlefield, under Article 79 of
Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions and Resolution 2222 of the
United Nations Security Council. The emblems of national governments
and inter-governmental organizations protect diplomatic pouches,
couriers, and envoys under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations. Other marks enjoy protections against mis-use under the
Paris Convention, the Madrid Protocol, and the Trade-Related Aspects
of Intellectual Property Rights.

Such physical emblems do not translate to the digital realm and also
suffer from a number of weaknesses in the physical world.
For example, there is no current capability that allows an organization
to indicate that its digital infrastructure should be afforded
protections under an international law due to its use in a physical mission.
The Digital Emblem BoF at IETF 120 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/diem/about/)
explored the problem space, discussed technical requirements from various
stakeholders, and helped frame the problem in terms of potential efforts within the
IETF. This BoF is a venue for discussing the chartering of perspective work on the topic of digital emblems.
